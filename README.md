Pokelection Game


Game Synopsis :
This game was developed as the first of many projects for General 
Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. It was inspired by 
a homework assignment as well as the upcoming 2016 presedential election. 
My intention while developing this game was not to hurt or offend anyone. 
I developed this game, simply for fun. If I have hurt or offended anyone
unknowingly, I am sincerely sorry. 

This game is a two player game. In order to start the game, one of the
players must click the start game button. This will then activate the timer.
The game is set within a timer of 60 seconds. There are are two players, 
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Each player starts with a credibility
of 100 points. Each player has 12 attacks which have been randomized,
as well as a 2 out of 12 chance of missing the opponent. Whenever a player 
their attack button and attacks their opponent, their attack has a 5-20 
point effect on the opponents credibility. Each player is also able to 
recover anywhere between 5-20 points when the recover button is clicked.
Each player may only attack and recover once when it is their turn. In order
to determine who's turn it currently is, the opponent's attack and
recover buttons will disappear. After the start game button is clicked,
Hillary Clinton must go first. Whoever has the most credibility by the end 
of the game is then elected president of the United States. A button 
saying "Play Again?" will then appear in place of the start game button
asking the players whether or not they'd like to restart the game and play 
again. 

Technologies utilized : HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery

user stories: As a player, I wanted a game that was fun and interactive


*Pseudocode/MVP*
-This originally started out as a 1 player game, but as the development
continued, it became a 2 player game. 

-I had originally wanted to include all the current presidential
election candidates in this game, but then reduced the game to only two
candidates. 

-Wanted to use candidates' slogans for them to able to recover (ex: I'm with
Her & Make America Great Again)

-Made attacks random policies from both candidates as well as insults

-Established buttons such as start game, play again, attack, and recover

-Had to figure out when to hide and show buttons

-Couldn't figure out why CSS animations only work sometimes
